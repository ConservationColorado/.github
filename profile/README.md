## About our organization

As the largest statewide environmental organization in Colorado, we work to protect our state’s climate, air, land, 
water, and communities. We play a unique role in Colorado as our work focuses on organizing communities, influencing 
decision-makers, and electing conservation-minded leaders. We believe that achieving racial, social, and environmental 
justice are critical to our mission.

Conservation Colorado is a family of five different legal entities focused on education, organizing, elections, and 
our Protégete program. Protégete—which means “protect yourself” in Spanish—is focused on building Latinx leadership 
and engagement on environmental issues.
